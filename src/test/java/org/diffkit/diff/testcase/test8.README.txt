Description
----------
Compare two DB tables using the most automatic default provided by the MagicPlan. Only the two table names
and the ConnectionInfo are provided in the plan file. Everything else is figured out by MagicPlan.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- MagicPlan uses EqualsDiffor across the board
- MagicPlan defaults to looking for ROW and COLUMN type Diffs
- MagicPlan sets max diffs to Long.MAX

Expectations
-----------
- 2 column diffs
- 4 row diffs
