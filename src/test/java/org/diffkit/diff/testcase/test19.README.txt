Description
----------
Exercise of various SQL data types: VARCHAR, BIGINT, DATE, CHAR, TIME, INT, 
DECIMAL, DOUBLE, REAL, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN, TINYINT, SMALLINT, CLOB


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- DB tables use SQL data types: VARCHAR, BIGINT, DATE, CHAR, TIME, INT, DECIMAL, DOUBLE, REAL, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN, TINYINT, SMALLINT, CLOB, NCHAR, NVARCHAR
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- MagicPlan uses EqualsDiffor across the board
- MagicPlan defaults to looking for ROW and COLUMN type Diffs
- MagicPlan sets max diffs to Long.MAX


Expectations
-----------
- 14 column diff
- 2 row diffs
