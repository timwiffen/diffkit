Description
----------
Demonstrates situation where all columns in target tables are part of primary
key defined in the database. This covers issue #62. Even though it's not possible
to search for column diffs in this scenario, DiffKit must still be able to properly
find row diffs.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- both tables have PK defined in the DB
- table structures are identical on both sides
- all columns in table pariticipate in the PK
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database

Expectations
-----------
- no column diffs
- last row (cccc,3333,cccc/xxxx) should create two row diffs
