Description
----------
Compare two DB tables using mostly automatic default provided by the MagicPlan. Plan specifies keyColumnNames, 
which are different from the pk defined in the database for the target table. If alignment was carried out using 
table pk (column1), all rows would be row diffs. Instead, engine is able to align the rows and produce only column diffs
because of the keyColumnName override (column3).


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- lhs vs. rhs has only column diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- MagicPlan uses COLUMN 3 as the key for both tables. This overrides the definition in the DB (column1).


Expectations
-----------
- 7 column diffs
