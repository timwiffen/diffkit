Description
---------- 
Test of diffKind and maxDiffs properties in MagicPlan. Plan limits
diffs to ROW_DIFF diffs only, and maxDiffs of 2. If BOTH kinds of diffs were
reported, there would be 4 COLUMN_DIFFs, in addition to the 2 ROW_DIFFs. But the
diffKind property filters those out. If maxDiff was not specified, it would 
default to a huge number (Long.MAX), and all 3 row diffs would be reported. But 
since maxDiffs is specified to the MagicPlan, only the first 2 ROW_DIFFs are
reported.

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are File tables
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- MagicPlan figures everything out
- only report ROW diffs
- report maxDiffs = 2


Expectations
-----------
- no column diffs in expected, even though column diffs exist between sources
- two row diffs, even though 3 exist
