Description
----------
Demonstrates the TextDiffor and how it can be used to compare CLOBs in a way
that is insensitive to newlines. Also demonstrates the use of the whereClause.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan specifies the whereClause, the same applied to both sides
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan will assign TextDiffor, that ignores newlines, to CLOB columns
- column2 is a CLOB
- row 'bbbb' differs lhs vs. rhs only in the CLOB column, and only by newlines
- column3 has diffs

Expectations
-----------
- 1 COLUMN_DIFF diff
- row 'bbbb' is not seen as a diff
- no diffs are seen in column3, because the where clause filters those out
