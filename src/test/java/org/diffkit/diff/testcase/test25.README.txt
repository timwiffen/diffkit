Description
----------
Demonstrates the use of dbTableName in MagicPlan. The table name is the
same on the LHS and RHS. Also demonstrates use of whereClause in MagicPlan. 
The where clause is the same on the LHS and RHS.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- plan file supplies only dbTableName, not lhs table name or rhs table name
- dbsetup.xml only creates on table: TEST25_TABLE
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- since LHS and RHS point to the same table, there can be no diffs.

Expectations
-----------
- no diffs
