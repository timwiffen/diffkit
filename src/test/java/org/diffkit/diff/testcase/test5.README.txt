Description
----------
Compare two File tables using the most straightforward possible comparison.  
Everything is wired explicitly into a PassthroughPlan. Plan limits diffs to ROW_DIFF diffs only.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are File tables
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- TableModel specifies compound primary key
- Comparisons are all passthrough-- column identical on both sides & only Equals comparison
- only report ROW diffs

Expectations
-----------
- no column diffs in expected, even though column diffs exist between sources
- four row diffs
