Description
----------
Compare SpreadSheet tables using a PassthroughPlan. Demonstrates leaving the sheet 
name blank in the plan, so that the first sheet is used by default. Demonstrates
explicitly modeling the ROW_NUM, and how ROW_DIFFs are reported when using ROW_NUM
as the key. Demonstrates use of header row (hasHeader -> true). 
Exercises several different data types. 

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are SpreadSheet FILE tables
- plan file supplies lhs and rhs spreadsheet file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- PassthroughPlan specifies identical TableModels for LHS and RHS
- PassthroughPlan specifies most straightforward TableComparison (mappings) 
- ROW_NUM column is specified as part of the TableModel in the PassthroughPlan file.
- ROW_NUMs is used as key
- PassthroughPlan specifies that a header row is present, so will identify diffs
using column names from header, instead of default Excel column name (A,B,C....).

Expectations
-----------
- 1 ROW_DIFF, becuase ROW_NUM is used for alignment and only ROW_NUM=7 is
different between the two side
- 32 COLUMN_DIFFs. All columns must be different in the rows where one side is blank
and the other side isn't (ROW_NUM= 2,3,6 = 3 rows * 8 columns = 24 ROW_DIFFs). 
All columns explicitly set to different values in ROW_NUM = 5 in order to exercise each column.
