test32 README
=========

Description
----------
This test is the same as test31, except that the key is COLUMN1 instead of <ROW_NUM>,
and the spreadsheets are not pre-sorted (isSorted = false), so that DiffKit has to
sort them internally before diff'ng.
Compare SpreadSheet tables using a PassthroughPlan. Demonstrates leaving the sheet 
name blank in the plan, so that the first sheet is used by default. Demonstrates
how ROW_DIFFs are generated when rows are aligned on COLUMN1, instead of ROW_NUM
(e.g. Test31). Demonstrates use of header row (hasHeader -> true). 
Exercises several different data types. 

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are SpreadSheet FILE tables
- plan file supplies lhs and rhs spreadsheet file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- PassthroughPlan specifies identical TableModels for LHS and RHS
- PassthroughPlan specifies most straightforward TableComparison (mappings) 
- ROW_NUM column is *not* specified as part of the TableModel in the PassthroughPlan file.
- COLUMN1 is specified as the key
- PassthroughPlan specifies that a header row is present, so will identify diffs
using column names from header, instead of default Excel column name (A,B,C....).

Expectations
-----------
- 3 ROW_DIFFs
