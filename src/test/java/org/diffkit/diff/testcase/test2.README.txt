Description
----------
Compare two DB tables using the most straightforward possible comparison.  
Everything is wired explicitly into a PassthroughPlan.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- TableModel specifies compound primary key
- Comparisons are all passthrough-- column identical on both sides & only Equals comparison

Expectations
-----------
- first and last diffs are column diffs
- four other row diffs
