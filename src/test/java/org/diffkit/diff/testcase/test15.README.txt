=========

Description
----------
Test global numberTolerance and toleranceMap. MagicPlan will ensure that no numeric diffs of magnitude
less than 3 will be considered (numberTolerance =2), and that any diffs in COLUMN3 and COLUMN4 that 
are not greater than 4 (toleranceMap; 4=COLUMN3,COLUMN4) will be ignored.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- lhs vs. rhs has column and row diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- MagicPlan builds TableComparison to globally tolerate diffs of 2 or less in any numeric columns
- MagicPlan overrides the global tolerance for COLUMN3 and COLUMN4, setting it to 4 instead of 2


Expectations
-----------
- 2 row diffs
- 4 column diffs, all in COLUMN4, because all other diffs (in COLUMN2 and COLUMN3) are within tolerance.
