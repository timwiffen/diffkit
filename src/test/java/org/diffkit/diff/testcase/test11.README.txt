Description
----------
Compare two file tables using mostly automatic default provided by the MagicPlan. Plan specifies keyColumnNames, 
which are different from the default pk (first column) for file based tables. If alignment was carried out using 
default pk (column1), all rows would be row diffs. Instead, engine is able to align the rows and produce only column diffs
because of the keyColumnName override (column3).


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are FILE tables
- lhs vs. rhs has only column diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table  and rhs table file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- MagicPlan uses COLUMN 3 as the key for both tables. This overrides the default definition for FILE sources


Expectations
-----------
- 7 column diffs
