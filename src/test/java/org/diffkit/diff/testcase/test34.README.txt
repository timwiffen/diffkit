test34 README
=========

Description
---------- 
Compare SpreadSheet tables using a MagicPlan. Key is COLUMN1 instead
of <ROW_NUM>, and the spreadsheets are not pre-sorted (isSorted = false), so
that DiffKit has to sort them internally before diff'ng. Demonstrates leaving
the sheet name blank in the plan, so that the first sheet is used by default.
Demonstrates how ROW_DIFFs are generated when rows are aligned on COLUMN1,
instead of ROW_NUM (e.g. Test31). Demonstrates use of header row (hasHeader ->
true). Exercises several different data types. This is functionally same as
test32, except that this test is specified using a MagicPlan, whereas 32 uses a
PassthroughPlan.

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are SpreadSheet FILE tables
- MagicPlan supplies lhs and rhs spreadsheet file paths
- MagicPlan supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- No key is specified in the MagicPlan, so ROW_NUM should be used
- MagicPlan specifies that a header row is present, so will identify diffs
using column names from header, instead of default Excel column name (A,B,C....).

Expectations
-----------
- 3 ROW_DIFFs
