Description
----------
Test DBSource where clause. There are two rows on the lhs (COLUMN1=0, 5555) that are not on the rhs.
By default, these would generate ROW diffs. However, we add a lhsWhereClause to the MagicPlan that
excludes all rows only the rhs that are not on the lhs. The result is that the diff report contains only 
column diffs.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- lhs vs. rhs has column and row diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- plan file supplies where clause to lhs DBSource that will filter out rows not on the rhs
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name

Expectations
-----------
- 12 COLUMN diffs
