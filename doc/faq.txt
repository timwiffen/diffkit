== Does DiffKit work with Java 1.4?

No. DiffKit works only with Java 1.5+.

== Does DiffKit have a GUI (Graphical User Interface)?

No. DiffKit works strictly from the command line, and is configured with XML
files.

== Is there any documentation?

Yes, DiffKit is documented extensively. Please read the QuickStart document and
the User Guide.

== How do I know that DiffKit is producing correct results?

DiffKit is covered by an extensive functional TestSuite, which exercises all
major features of the framework. All tests in this TestSuite are thoroughly
documented. You can exercise the TestSuite at any time:

---------
java -jar diffkit-app.jar -test
---------
In the above invocation, the TestSuite executes against an embedded H2 database.
To execute the TestSuite against your database, edit the dbConnectionInfo
configuration files in the conf/ directory (either DB2 or Oracle). Then invoke
the TestSuite with a "flavors" parameter value (e.g. if you have an Oracle
database):
-------------------------------
   java -jar diffkit-app.jar -test flavors=ORACLE
-------------------------------
