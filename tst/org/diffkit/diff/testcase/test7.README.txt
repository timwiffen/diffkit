Description
----------
Compare two File tables using the most straightforward possible comparison.  
Everything is wired explicitly into a PassthroughPlan. Plan limits total number of diffs (maxDiffs) to 2.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are File tables
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- TableModel specifies compound primary key
- Comparisons are all passthrough-- column identical on both sides & only Equals comparison
- maxDiffs = 2

Expectations
-----------
- only the first 2 diffs are reported
- diffs 3-6 are ignored
