Description
----------
Compare across different databases. Compare two DB tables using the most automatic 
default provided by the MagicPlan. Only the two table names and the ConnectionInfo are 
provided in the plan file. Everything else is figured out by MagicPlan.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs is in one database, rhs is in a different database
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies lhs and rhs ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- MagicPlan uses EqualsDiffor across the board
- MagicPlan defaults to looking for ROW and COLUMN type Diffs
- MagicPlan sets max diffs to Long.MAX



Expectations
-----------
- 2 column diffs
- 4 row diffs
