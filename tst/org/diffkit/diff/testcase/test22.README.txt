=========

Description
---------- 
Demonstrates ability of TestCaseRunner to test for Exceptions (or failures) of 
a specified type. In this case, the MagicPlan file specifies displayColumnNames
that don't exist in the sources. So we expect that the framework will throw an
appropriate exception.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- plan file supplies key for ordering the rows
- plan file specifies displayColumnNames that don't exist in specified sources
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan construction process validates the displayColumnNames against DB tables

Expectations
-----------
- displayColumNames validation fails
- a DKUserException (end user targeted) is thrown by framework, and caught by TCR
- message in DKUserException indicates which column names fail validation
