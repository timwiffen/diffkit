Description
----------
Test the boundary case where one table (LHS) has rows, but the other table (RHS) is empty.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- lhs has rows, rhs is empty
- all rows from lhs should show up as ROW diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name

Expectations
-----------
- 12 ROW diffs -- all rows from LHS
