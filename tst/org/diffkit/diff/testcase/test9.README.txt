Description
----------
Compare two file tables using the most automatic default provided by the MagicPlan. Only the two file paths 
and the file path for the Sink are provided in the plan file. Everything else is figured out by MagicPlan.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are FILE tables
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table  and rhs table file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the column headers in the data file
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- MagicPlan uses Equals Diff across the board
- MagicPlan defaults to looking for ROW and COLUMN type Diffs
- MagicPlan sets max diffs to Long.MAX

Expectations
-----------
- 2 column diffs
- 4 row diffs
