Description
----------
Demonstrates SqlPatchSink, and how it is used to generate SQL statements 
(INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) in order to synchronize two tables. Also demonstrates
how DiffKit handles creating DML statements for Strings that contain embedded
single quotes (')


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan specifies the patchFileName, which configures a SqlPatchSink.
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- there is 

Expectations
-----------
- 2 missing row diffs result in 2 INSERT statements.
- 2 extra row diffs result in 2 DELETE statements.
- column diff on row 3 result in UPDATE statement with 1 value.
- 3 column diffs on row 4 result in UPDATE statement with 3 values.
