Description
----------
Compare heterogenous sources, lhs is DB rhs is FILE, using MagicPlan. Differences in table structure are
silently ignored by AutomaticTableComparison. Column3 is a BIGINT in the DB, but a STRING in the FILE, 
because the FILE is only auto modelled. So the Diffor has to perform conversion.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs is DB table
- rhs is FILE table
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- table structures are different. AutomaticTableComparison ensures that only matching column names are used
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs file name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- MagicPlan reverse engineers lhs TableModel from the database
- MagicPlan reverse engineers rhs TableModel from the file
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- Column3 comparison converts the FILE value from STRING to LONG before diffing

Expectations
-----------
- 2 column diffs
- 3 row diffs
- diff in row COLUMN1=3333 is not found because it occurs in COLUMN4, which was not in diffColumnNames list.
