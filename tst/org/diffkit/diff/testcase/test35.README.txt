Description
----------
Compare a spreadsheet against a flat-file using a MagicPlan. Both the flat-file 
and the SS have a header. Assumes that both files are already sorted. Also
demonstrate numerical tolerance. Without tolerance, values in COLUMN8 and COLUMN9
will be different in all rows.

[N.B. Using a MagicPlan, it's currently possible to diff spreadsheet vs. flat-file 
only in the case where the key in the spreadsheet is type String. That's because the 
key type in the spreadsheet must match the key type in the flat-file, and all
columns are always typed to String in a flat-file when using a MagicPlan.]

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs is a SpreadSheet FILE table
- rhs is a csv FILE table
- MagicPlan supplies lhs spreadsheet file path
- MagicPlan supplies rhs csv file path
- MagicPlan supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- key is specified as COLUMN1, which is Type String in SS
- MagicPlan specifies that a header row is present, so will identify diffs
using column names from header, instead of default Excel column name (A,B,C....).

Expectations
------------
- 1 ROW_DIFF
- 4 COLUMN_DIFFs (diffs in row='oooo'/col=column8 and row='qqqq'/col=column9
exceed the specified tolerance.
