Description
----------
A basic sanity check that compares two identical Excel XLSX File Tables using the
most straightforward possible comparison. Everything is wired explicitly into a
PassthroughPlan.

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are File tables
- lhs == rhs
- ROW_NUM column is not specified as part of the TableModel in the PassthroughPlan file.
So ROW_NUMs not used.
- hasHeader is TRUE, so first row is interpreted as column names
- isSorted is TRUE, so DKSpreadSheetSource will not attempt to sort the rows
- Comparisons are all passthrough-- column identical on both sides & only Equals
comparison

Expectations
-----------
- no diffs
