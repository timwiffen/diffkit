Description
----------
Compare a SpreadSheet on the LHS vs. a DB Source on the RHS, using a MagicPlan.
Demonstrates the use of ToleranceMap. Also highlights a bug in DiffKit data type
coercion. COLUMN5 has the same type (to the extent that you can clearly type SS
columns) in both the SS and the DB: Time. It's read from both sources a java.sql.Time,
however there is some subtle difference in the way that the values are read that
results in different Time (reported by getTime()) values. So COLUMN5 generates
a diff in every row even though the values appear to be the same in the diff
report file.

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs is a SpreadSheet FILE table
- rhs is DB table

- MagicPlan supplies lhs spreadsheet file path
- MagicPlan supplies rhs DB table name and ConnectionInfo
- MagicPlan supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have nearly identical structure
- key is specified as COLUMN1, which is Type String in SS
- MagicPlan specifies that a header row is present in the Spreadsheet.

Expectations
-----------
- 7 ROW_DIFFs
- 33 COLUMN_DIFFs
