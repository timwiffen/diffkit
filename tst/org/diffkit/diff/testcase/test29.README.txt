Description
----------
Compare SpreadSheet tables using a PassthroughPlan. Demonstrates targeting an 
explicitly named sheet, rather than defaulting to first sheet. Also demonstrates
a SpreadSheet that exercises all of the different data types available within 
DiffKit for describing columns. 

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are SpreadSheet FILE tables
- plan file supplies lhs and rhs spreadsheet file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- PassthroughPlan specifies identical TableModels for LHS and RHS
- PassthroughPlan specifies most straightforward TableComparison (mappings) 
- ROW_NUM column is not specified as part of the TableModel in the PassthroughPlan file.
So ROW_NUMs not used.
- PassthroughPlan specifies no header
- PassthroughPlan specifies that key is first column (A).

Expectations
-----------
- 9 ROW_DIFFs
- 15 COLUMN_DIFFs
