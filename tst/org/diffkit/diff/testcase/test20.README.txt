Description
----------
Demos issue 5. The target DB tables do not have PK defined at the SQL level. User
has specified keyColumnNames in the plan file. DKDBSource must reorder the rows 
appropriately for the key definition in the plan file to assure that there is only
1 row diff.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are DB tables
- DB tables do not have PK defined
- plan file supplies lhs table name and rhs table name
- plan file supplies ConnectionInfo to H2 DB
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- plan file supplies key for ordering the rows
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the database
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs column based on name
- MagicPlan generates SQL SELECT using plan supplied keyColumnNames for the ORDER BY clause
- MagicPlan uses EqualsDiffor across the board
- MagicPlan defaults to looking for ROW and COLUMN type Diffs
- MagicPlan sets max diffs to Long.MAX


Expectations
-----------
- 1 row diff
